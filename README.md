### Hi, I'm [Audrey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/audrey-keener-675aa721b/) (@keenera)! 👩🏻‍🦰🌻💻🫶🪴🍵

I'm a third-year undergraduate **Computer Science** major and **Mathematics** minor at the University of Pennsylvania's School of Engineering and Applied Science.

I'm passionate about...
- Low-level and systems programming
- Software engineering and product development
- Algorithms
- Teaching and CS education: I'm a Teaching Assistant for CIS 1200 (Programming Languages & Techniques I) - one of the largest courses at UPenn, taught in OCaml and intermediate Java. I also teach entry-level workshops on Git and Github!

Note: Many projects mentioned on my resume are private repositories due to course policies.

You can reach me at **[keenera@seas.upenn.edu](mailto:keenera@seas.upenn.edu)** or **[eajkkeener@gmail.com](mailto:eajkkeener@gmail.com)**!
